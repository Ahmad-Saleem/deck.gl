        <h1><a href="/2017/visualization-framework-suite">The Birth of a Visualization Framework Suite</a></h1>
        <p>The basic idea behind today's by taking Uber's most popular open source Visualization frameworks, and aligning their websites, documentation and examples, and providing links between the websites, we can make our various frameworks significantly easier to discover and use for both new and experienced users.</p>

        <p>In many ways v4.0 is the biggest luma.gl release to date. It is a major upgrade that brings full WebGL2 support to luma.gl, as well as adding advanced features such as GL state management and a shader module system.</p>

        <h1><a href="/2017/wind-map">Wind Map</a></h1>
        <p>A few weeks ago I set on trying out new WebGL 2.0 features with deck.gl. WebGL 2.0 brings plenty of new goodies to be used for game development, creative coding and data visualization like instancing, floating-point textures, transform feedback, multiple render targets, and more. With this in mind, and inspired by the work of Cameron Beccario, Viegas and Wattenberg and NASA I created a WebGL 2.0 wind map demo using deck.gl.</p>

        <p>I built a Minecraft Chunk Viewer, featuring a custom deck.gl layer that renders Minecraft blocks. Here's an in-depth look at how it works!</p>

        <h1><a href="/2017/introducing-deckgl-v4">Introducing deck.gl v4.0</a></h1>
        <p>We've just released a new major version of deck.gl, so this is a good time to share some information about the improvements that went into the new version, the rationale behind them, and some hints on what we are currently thinking about the future of deck.gl.</p>
